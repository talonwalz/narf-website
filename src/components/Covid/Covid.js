            <h3>IMPORTANT COVID-19 INFORMATION</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>At Northern Arizona Rehabilitation and Fitness, there is nothing more important to us than your health and safety during this unprecedented time. The Department of Homeland Security and state governments have deemed physical therapy an essential component of health care during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; therefore, our clinic remains open to serve those in need. We are taking extensive preventative measures, guided by the CDC, to protect our patients and employees who enter our clinic.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We hope that by providing this information you can make a clear decision to continue your plan of care with us during this time. The following protocols are now in place:</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>PATIENT SCREENING</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>All patients will be screened upon arrival of their appointment time to make sure they are not exhibiting symptoms. If a patient is presenting with COVID-19 symptoms, they will be advised to return home and contact their physician.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>STAFF SCREENING</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>All employees will be screened for COVID-19 daily. Those presenting any level of symptoms will not report to work and will follow up with their physician before returning to work.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>HEALTH HYGIENE PROTOCOLS</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>Ongoing reinforcement to all staff regarding hand washing and other preventative measures for equipment and supplies are in place and being enforced.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>SOCIAL DISTANCING</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>We have repositioned tables and equipment throughout the clinics to provide recommended distance. Schedules have been limited to prevent concentrations of individuals more than the recommended amount. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>For patients coming to our clinics for care, we ask that you please limit the number of people who accompany you to your appointments unless they are necessary for transportation or assistance. If for any reason you are not feeling well, please contact the clinic and we will be happy to reschedule your appointment.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>**If you do not feel comfortable coming to a clinic for care during this time, we will gladly reschedule your appointment for a later date.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Thank you for helping us ensure the safety of our patients and employees, as well as families of both.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Sincerely</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Tarrin M. Walz, PT, MS, Owner</p>
