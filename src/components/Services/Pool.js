                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <p>Aquatic Therapy is provided by our physical therapy staff in our multi-depth, therapeutic pool at Northern Arizona Rehabilitation & Fitness. It is offered as a modality in conjunction with land based therapy or by itself as the primary therapy if appropriate. Individuals can access the pool either by stairs or a hydraulic lift that uses a chair or stretcher. Depths range from 4 to 6 feet.</p>

                    <summary>Increase in Joint Flexibility</summary>
                    <p>Buoyancy offers a tremendous advantage because it reduces the effects of gravity allowing for increased joint range of motion. </p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Increase in Muscle Strength</summary>
                    <p>Water is 600-700 times more resistive than air which allows for strengthening of weakened muscles.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Decrease in Pain</summary>
                    <p>Immersion in warm water increases an individualâ€™s comfort, by increasing blood supply to sore muscles and promoting relaxation. Weight relief to weakened body structures also creates additional comfort.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Decrease in Abnormal Tone, Spasticity, and Rigidity</summary>
                    <p>Water temperatures above 92 degrees in conjunction with hands on techniques are effective in creating neutral warmth that reduces increased tone due to a neurological injury.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Improved Balance</summary>
                    <p>The uniform pressure of the water along with buoyancy provides support to your body which allows you increased time to react without the fear of falling or getting hurt.</p>
